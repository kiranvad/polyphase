Started Ray on this node. You can add additional nodes to the cluster by calling

    ray start --address='10.116.28.10:6379' --redis-password='e0d9ea7a-5e7b-4a39-8968-b23a8035e7bb'

    import ray
    ray.init(address='auto', redis_password='e0d9ea7a-5e7b-4a39-8968-b23a8035e7bb')

It requires {CPU: 1.000000} for execution and {CPU: 1.000000} for placement, but this node only has remaining {node:10.116.28.26: 1.000000}, {CPU: 20.000000}, {memory: 42.968750 GiB}, {object_store_memory: 12.695312 GiB}. In total there are 1 pending tasks and 0 pending actors on this node. This is likely due to all cluster resources being claimed by actors. To resolve the issue, consider creating fewer actors or increase the resources available to this Ray cluster. You can ignore this message if this Ray cluster is expected to auto-scale.
