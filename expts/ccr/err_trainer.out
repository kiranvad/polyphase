Started Ray on this node. You can add additional nodes to the cluster by calling

    ray start --address='10.116.28.9:6379' --redis-password='fa13ae38-9374-4be6-9b48-de6e918c4f09'

from the node you wish to add. You can connect a driver to the cluster from Python by running

    import ray
    ray.init(address='auto', redis_password='fa13ae38-9374-4be6-9b48-de6e918c4f09')

If you have trouble connecting from a different machine, check that your firewall is configured properly. If you wish to terminate the processes that have been started, run
